# Zomato Project

## Overview

This project was developed during an internship at Ai Variant and involves the analysis of Zomato's restaurant data using various data processing and analytical techniques. The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to restaurant operations, customer preferences, and market trends.

## Features

- **Country Map Table**: Developed a country map table to map data according to geographical regions.
- **Calendar Table**: Created a calendar table using `DateKey` with additional columns such as Year, Month, Quarter, Financial Month, and more to facilitate time-based analyses.
- **Restaurant Analytics**:
  - Number of restaurants by city and country.
  - Analysis of restaurant openings by year, quarter, and month.
  - Classification of restaurants based on average ratings and pricing.
  - Percentage of restaurants offering table booking and online delivery.
  - Visualization of cuisine preferences, city-based distribution, and ratings.

## Technology Stack

- **Data Analysis**: Excel for initial data analysis and processing.
- **Visualization**: Tableau and Power BI for creating interactive dashboards and charts.
- **Database Management**: SQL for managing data and running complex queries.
- **Project Management**: Organized tasks and milestones within the scope of the internship project.

## Internship Experience

This project was part of my internship at Ai Variant, where I gained hands-on experience in data analysis, SQL querying, and data visualization. I worked on real-world data, tackling challenges in data cleaning, processing, and deriving actionable insights. The project helped me develop a strong foundation in data analytics and enhanced my problem-solving skills.
